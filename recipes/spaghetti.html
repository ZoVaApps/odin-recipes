    <h2>The Worlds Best Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>While I have several quick and easy spaghetti recipes like my pasta pomodoro or spaghetti carbonara that are ready in minutes, this spaghetti and meat sauce recipe is the ultimate Sunday, long-simmer dinner.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Beef broth</li>
        <li>Canned mushrooms</li>
        <li>A splash of wine</li>
        <li>Onion, celery and fresh garlic</li>
        <li>Dried herbs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of sugar for sweetness</li>
        <li>Dried whole cloves!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Brown the beef. Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>
        <li>Boil and simmer. Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the Italians do, (fuhgetaboutit).</li>
        <li>Cook your noodles. Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
    </ul>
